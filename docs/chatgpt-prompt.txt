I need your help writing a software specification.

I want to build a flashcards web app to help Russian speakers learn English, using TypeScript and Vite/React.

Here are the main features I want:

Each card should show an English word/phrase on one side and the Russian translation on the other.

Users should be able to flip the card to see the Russian translation.

After flipping, there should be two buttons under each card: “Got it right” and “Got it wrong.”

The app should remember which cards I got wrong.

A review mode to practice only the cards I don’t know.

A quiz/test mode with multiple-choice and fill-in-the-blank options.

A statistics page to track how many cards I’ve studied and my correct vs. incorrect answers.

The output should be written and formatted in Markdown.

If anything is unclear, please ask follow-up questions before you start writing.
